# Uber

This app replicates the functionality of the Uber app. Below are the user stories for the expected behaviour, the application is written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) following Object Orientated Programming principles. The tests have been written using [rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec).

```
As a rider
In order to use Uber
I want to create an account with my details

As a driver

## Instructions to clone to your computer

1. Clone the repo, instructions can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
2. You will need to install the dependencies (known as Ruby gems), to do this use the command `bundle install --path vendor/bundle`
3. To run the rspec tests run the command `bundle exec rspec` from your terminal
4. There will be a few tests that are failing - debug to fix them


## Instructions to clone to Replit

1. Go to https://repl.it/ and sign up if you don't have an account
2. Select to create a new Replit and upload fromm github. Use the link https://github.com/Caitlin-cooling/uber-AIP note that this is cloning and can take a little while - watch the progress in your console tab
3. The dependencies will be installed for you, just run `rspec` in your console to run the tests
4. There will be a few tests that are failing - debug to fix them

If you get all tests passing and have some time to spare, have a go at finishing the app using these user stories. You will want to write tests to ensure everything is working as expected.

```
In order to be paid correctly
As a driver
If the rider cancels I need to be paid a cancellation fee

In order to pay for my ride
As a rider
I would like to add a my card number
```

## Notes to solution

Workshop participants have previously had extra difficulty with the fifth failing test: "Rider end_journey method if 
pick up and drop off points are the same an exception is thrown".

People often encounter trouble setting a pick up point in the test. This is because the failing test (in rider_spec.rb) 
is testing the Rider class and we provide a Journey mock (aka “double”) in line 6. In line 36, we have to configure that 
Journey mock to respond to the pick_up_point call with “Buckley Building” so that we can create the scenario where pick 
up point is same as drop off point, and see the exception raised.
